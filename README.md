# E-Commerce Website Project

## Project Overview

We are seeking proposals from qualified web development teams or freelancers to build a simple, responsive e-commerce website consisting of three primary pages: a **Profile Page**, a **Cart Page**, and an **Items Listing Page**. This project is designed to be lightweight with no user authentication, and the cart will be stored locally on the user's browser (local storage). The goal is to create a visually appealing, functional, and responsive website.

## Scope of Work

The website will have the following pages:

### 1. Profile Page
- A simple page displaying static information about the user, such as name, email, and contact information.
- The page will have a clean and minimal design.

### 2. Cart Page
- The cart will show all items added by the user, stored in local storage.
- Users can view items, update item quantities, and remove items from the cart.
- A **"Checkout" button** will be included, but it will not perform any payment or backend action (dummy button).

### 3. Items Listing Page
- This page will list all available products with basic details (image, name, price, and description).
- Users can add items to the cart, which will be reflected in the cart page via local storage.
- A search bar or filters can be implemented for item categories.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**:  
  The website must be fully responsive and work seamlessly on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). The layout should be optimized to ensure a good user experience across all devices.

- **Local Storage for Cart**:  
  All cart items will be stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the cart persists until the user clears their browser data.

- **User Interface**:  
  The website must be easy to navigate and visually appealing, with attention to typography, colors, and layout.
